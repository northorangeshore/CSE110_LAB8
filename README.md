## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Service workers support graceful degradation by allowing users to keep their websites running offline. Graceful degradation focuses on building advanced features first, while also ensuring that core features remain functional in older browsers, restricted devices, or poor connected environments. Service workers can cache essential assets and content to help resolve one of these edge cases offline to allow users to load and interact with websites. In this way, service workers are tools that enable graceful degradation in the face of network failure.
